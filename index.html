  Hi I'm Phoebe. Welcome to my life!
  Here's a list of things you can learn about me:

  I'm from Barbados. I was born and raised there. I moved to Canada for school four years ago.
  I lived in Oakville, and attended Appleby College for Grade 11 and 12. I was an international boarder and so I lived on campus in the boarding house. I loved Appleby - wish I had spent longer!
